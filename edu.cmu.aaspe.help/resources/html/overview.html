<p>The AASPE tools are developed for a SEI project to investigate how models can help to design safe &amp; secure systems. The project leverages the AADL ecosystem and its OSATE platform in order to analyze security aspects of an architecture.</p>
<p>This documentation introduces the different tools included in AASPE and detail how to use it. So far, the tool includes the following functionalities: * <strong>Attack Impact</strong> editor with an automatic generation from AADL model * <strong>Attack Tree</strong> editor with an automatic generation from an Attack Impact * <strong>Code Generation</strong> for secure and verified execution platforms (seL4)</p>
