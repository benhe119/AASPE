The AASPE tools are developed for a SEI project to investigate how models
can help to design safe & secure systems. The project leverages the AADL ecosystem and its OSATE platform in order to analyze security aspects of an architecture.

This documentation introduces the different tools included in AASPE and detail how to use it. So far, the tool includes the following functionalities:
 1. **Attack Impact** editor with an automatic generation from AADL model
 2. **Attack Tree** editor with an automatic generation from an Attack Impact
 3. **Code Generation** for secure and verified execution platforms (seL4)
